This program consists of three main components: ArrayBag, BagInterface, and TestArrayBag, forming a data structure project that implements and tests the functionality of a "bag" using arrays in Java.

Program Overview
BagInterface:

Defines the interface for the bag, outlining the operations that can be performed. These include:
Adding items to the bag.
Removing items (specific or unspecified).
Counting occurrences of items.
Checking if the bag contains specific items.
Converting the bag's contents to an array.
Clearing the bag.
ArrayBag:

Implements the BagInterface and provides concrete functionality for the bag operations.
Stores entries in an internal array with a fixed capacity.
Features operations like:
Adding and removing entries.
Counting occurrences of an entry.
Checking if the bag is full or empty.
Comparing equality between two bags.
Overrides the toString method to provide a human-readable format for displaying the bag's contents.
TestArrayBag:

A driver class to test the functionality of the ArrayBag.
Initializes multiple bags with different configurations (empty, single-item, multiple items).
Tests operations like:
Equality between bags.
Addition of items.
Clearing the bag.
Verifying the behavior of bags with varying sizes and content.
What This Program Does
Simulates a simple "bag" data structure for storing objects.
Demonstrates key object-oriented principles like abstraction (via BagInterface) and encapsulation.
Allows testing of operations to ensure correctness using sample data.
